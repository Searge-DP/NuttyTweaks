#Tweaks Galore!

Similar to TPPI-Tweaks, this mod brings tweaks and balances (all configurable) to my own custom packs. 

As it's a bit less directed towards TPPI, it may be useful to other pack developers.

##Requirements:

__This mod requires [RecipeTweakingCore](http://ci.tterrag.com/job/RecipeTweakingCore/) and [ttCore](http://ci.tterrag.com/job/ttCore/) by tterrag.__

I *do not* require any credit for this. I wrote it primarily for myself to use in my own packs and there's literally no reason for it to not be public.

##Developement setup:

In order to set this up in a dev environment, you need to get a Deobfuscated version of each of the following mods:

* [Dark Menagerie](http://minecraft.curseforge.com/mc-mods/224039-dark-menagerie)
* [Extra Utilities](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/wip-mods/1443963-extra-utilities-v1-1-0k)
* [Gravestones](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/1288082-gravestone-mod-v2-9-7)
* [Magical Crops](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/1287451-magical-crops-farm-your-resources-3-2-0-now-with)
* [Tinker's Construct](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/2218638-tinkers-construct)

Even if you don't plan to dev for X mod or even use it in your pack, the dev enviro needs it.

##FAQ:

* __Oh no! I found a bug/leak with it! D:__
   
   Please feel free to make a PR with a fix or open an issue on GitHub.

* __Can you include X feature?__
   
   Sure why not.

* __Why should I use this?__
   
   I feel it saves time for beginning modders so they don't have to rewrite everything whenever they start a new project. If you don't feel it's useful, don't use it. Simple as that.

* __Who the heck are you?__
  
   I am the lead dev of [Redstone Armory](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/2111983-) and a head dev of [Flowstone Energy](https://github.com/FlowstoneTeam/FlowstoneEnergy). 

   I also work on rewriting mods (Completely fresh code-base, custom textures, new names, etc) to balance them. BigReactors ([NuclearCubes](https://github.com/TehNut/NuclearCubes)) being a huge one. 

   I help out (More like rewrite his mods) [Tombenpotter](https://github.com/Tombenpotter) with Electro-Magic Tools and Sanguimancy.

   I am one of the developers of the TPPI (TestPackPleaseIgnore) modpack. It is public on both the FTB and Technic launchers.
